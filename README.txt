An iPython Notebook for tracking health related things.
Must have MongoDB and PyMongo installed and running for this notebook to work properly.

Some foods have been added to the top for ease of use, however this is a very inexhaustive list. In the future, foods will most likely get their own database. For now however, feel free to modify the list of foods as you like.


Instructions:

1) Start MongoDB with 'sudo mongod'
2) Start up your notebook and navigate to this directory
3) Profit.
